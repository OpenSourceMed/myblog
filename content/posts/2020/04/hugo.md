My new blog is here! The old one is there, on Blogger.

I just migrated my old articles to this new one by doing a "purge", meaning by removing some articles and just keeping the more important with the more value for others according to me.

# Where I moved?

Blogger was fine, great helper to write, publish and host my blog articles. But I decided to move a new setup:
- Hugo webisite
- Container
- Kubernetes

# Why I have moved?

- More technical writing in GitHub
- Easy dev/test and local writing and debugging
- MD files as article, I'm a big fan of *-as-Code!
- Container to simplify 
- Kubernetes to host the website, like all my other apps

Hope you like this story and hope you will like this new experience with my new blog!
