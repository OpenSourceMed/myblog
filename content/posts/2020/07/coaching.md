A colleague of mine just shared this article on LinkedIn: [The Best Way to Respond to the Question, "What Do You Do?"](https://hbrascend.org/topics/the-best-way-to-respond-to-the-question-what-do-you-do/). The author gives a great technique to answer a question like _"What do you do?"_ but by opening the door and actually open the conversation instead of closing it or going with long explanations.
> “Do you know anyone—could be you, a friend, or family member—who...?”

> This approach creates commonality—in 60 seconds or less—and gives you a hook on which to hang a mutually-rewarding conversation and connection.

This reminded me the training I took few months ago: [The Coaching Habit from Michael Bungay Stanier](https://www.amazon.com/Coaching-Habit-Less-Change-Forever/dp/0978440749).
That's kind of training I love to take, not technical at all but improving my soft-skills helping me getting better as a person, a dad, a saler, a partner, a friend, etc.

That book is all about how to become a great coach or mentor, and not just as a manager, but for any leader in ourself trying to help others growing personnaly as well as professionaly. Yep, even someone who is not a manager could be a leader! ;)

It's all about the leadership behavior: business result/impact & culture, nurture/ generating growth and work Less with more impact.

> Be Lazy, stop fixing/solving things, let them do the work

> Be Curious, stop giving so much advice, slow down the rush to offer up solutions and ideas

> Be Often, stop waiting for the right moment to coach someone, stay curious a little longer, do not rush to action

The author gives us 7 questions/tips you could use to any discussion you will have:
1. The kickstart question to get straight to the point in any conversation: **What’s on your mind?**
2. The AWE question to stay in track during any conversation: **And what else?**
3. The focus question: **What's the real challenge here for you?**
4. Habit formula: **When this happens... instead of... I will...**
q4 (foundation question): what do you want?
if this is your challenge for you, what do you want?
q5 (strategic question): what am I going to say yes to, and if I say yes to that, what must I say not to?
q6 (lazy question): how can I help? or what do you want from me?
q7: what was most useful or most valuable here for you?

Most of leaders just use 2 of them

Power of silence, Watch for the tendency to rescue people.

Ask yourself:

Why am I jumping in?

Why am I fixing it?

Am I noticing a need to save them, solve it for them?

Wait a little bit longer to see if they figure it out for themselves.
