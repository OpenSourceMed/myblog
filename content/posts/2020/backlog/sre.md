SLO with GKE at Equifax: cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions?session=OPS200

- SLI: service level indicator
    - _a well-defined measure of successful enough_

    - _a top-line target for fraction of successful interactions_
- SLA: service level agreement

5 key areas with SRE:
1. Reduce organizational silos: Share ownershop
2. Accept failure as normal: Error budgets & blameless postmortems
3. Implement gradual changes: Reduce cost of failure
4. Leverage tooling and automation: Automate common cases
5. Measure everything: Measure toil and reliability
