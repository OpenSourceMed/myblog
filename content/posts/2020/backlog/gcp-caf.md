Google Cloud Adoption Framework
https://cloud.google.com/adoption-framework/
The Google Cloud Adoption Framework
https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google_cloud_adoption_framework_whitepaper.pdf
> The Google Cloud Adoption Framework builds a structure on the rubric of people, process, and technology that you can work with, providing a solid assessment of where you are in your journey to the cloud and actionable programs that get you to where you want to be. It’s informed by Google’s own evolution in the cloud and many years of experience helping customers.
- 4 cloud adoption themes: Lean, Lead, Scale, Secure
- 3 maturity phases: Tactical, Strategic, Transformational


Managing change in the Cloud
https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/managing_change_in_the_cloud.pdf
> Organizations will only realize the full potential of new technology if employees use it, if they know how to make the most of it, and if they are empowered to do things differently than before.
10 things we’ve learned along the way:
1. Focus on the people, and all else will follow
2. Measure, measure, measure — so you’ll know if you’ve been successful
3. Be clear about the critical capabilities you will need in the future, and where you’ll get them — either internally or through your partner(s)
4. Fast is better than slow. But finding your balance between central control and agility can be hard
5. Sweat the basics: people will look to you for guidance
6. Ensure that there is a "nontech" learning plan available
7. Start thinking about the longer-term tech skills, now
8. Appeal to self-interest and growth
9. Things won’t be perfect the first time
10. Share what you learn along the way, both the positive and the negative

Cloud Center of Excellence whitepaper
https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/cloud_center_of_excellence.pdf
> A well-appointed Cloud COE begins with a small team who understands the [Google Cloud Adoption Framework](https://cloud.google.com/adoption-framework/) and is able to use it as a guide for implementing cloud technology aligned with a business’s goals and strategy. The Cloud COE team then becomes the conduit for transforming the way that the other internal teams serve the business in the transition to the cloud.
> The most successful Cloud COE teams are: Multidisciplinary, Empowered, Visionary, Agile, Technical, Engaged, Cloud-centric, Integrated, Hands-on and Small.

Building a Cloud Centre of Excellence in 2020: 13 Pitfalls and Practical Steps

> Instead, I prefer to think of a CCoE as an enablement function. On the one hand, a CCoE is there to provide a product (i.e. the cloud) but on the other hand it exists to enable consumers (i.e. the product and development teams) to consume this product. It does this by providing a set of repeatable standards, governance frameworks and best practices for the rest of the business to follow during the cloud migration. 
> At Contino, we recommend using [Simon Wardley’s organisational model](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/getting-started-yourself-e1a359b785a2) of Town Planners, Settlers and Pioneers (PST) to tailor and model the products and services being offered by the CCoE. The ‘PST’ model uses a cell-based organisational structure in which there are three groups of consumers that represent different levels of cloud maturity: Pioneers: we help you access cloud so you can “build it” and “run it”


Why Organizations Choose a Multicloud Strategy by Gartner

> Most organizations adopt a multicloud strategy out of a desire to avoid vendor lock-in or to take advantage of best-of-breed solutions
